bin/vm contains a script for simplifying vm start, stop, and device
attach/detach via virsh.

	vm		Start vm via virsh

	vm -d		Destroy vm via virsh

	vm <file>	Find <file>.xml is vm_xml_dir and try to attach the
			device hopefully described within it.

	vm -d <file>	Like above, except detach instead of attach.

	vm -r <file>	Like calling `vm -d <file>`, then `vm <file>`, except
			failure of the detach attempt is ignored.  You can use
			this to ensure the device is attached, or to reattach
			the device if needed.

The important variables to modify in the script are vm_xml_dir and vm_name.
Currently the script is only optimized for adminstrating 1 VM and having 1 xml
directory to search for the devices.

win10-2.xml is the domain xml for my personal VM.  It probably won't work on
your machine, so you need to have a usable domain.  It's kept here as an
example.  I version my domains since virsh destroys any valuable (and
invaluable) comments in the domain xml that it keeps.
