TODO:

Add options to `vm` for changing the base directory and domain.

Add functionality to `vm` to update domains.

Port to python, maybe.  Or some other language that isn't a quoting nightmare
(rc is pretty good, and leaves all our unixy utilities ripe for use).

Add default directory in XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vm_script to have our nice
configuration.

Add a REPL to administrate the system in realtime (so you can add/remove
devices more easily).
